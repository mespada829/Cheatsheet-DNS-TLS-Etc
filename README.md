**DNS** - The Domain Name System (DNS) to make it simple, is the phonebook of the Internet. 
In further detail DNS will translate domain names to IP addresses so any browser can load the website you would like to visit.





**DNS Resource Records**:

Name is an alphanumeric identifier of the DNS record

TTL (time to live) specifies how long the record should be kept in local cache

Record class indicates the namespace—typically IN, the Internet namespace

Record type is the DNS record type—for example an A, CNAME, MX

Record data contains the DNS values, for example the IP address for a hostname

IPv6 Address records (AAAA)—a hostname and its IPv6 address

Canonical Name records (CNAME)—points a hostname to an alias
